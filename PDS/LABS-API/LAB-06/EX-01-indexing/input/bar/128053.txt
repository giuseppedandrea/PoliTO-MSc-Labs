Read the interview and tell us what you love about Jordyn . <p> WHAT IS YOUR USUAL WORKOUT ROUTINE LIKE ? I try to do at least 20 to 30 minutes of cardio , starting to warm up and get your heart rate going . And then it 's good to always do abs . So every time you work out , do 30 minutes of cardio , always do abs , and then each day you can focus on a different part of your body . So one day you can focus on weight lifting for your arms and shoulders , one day for your back and one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TRACKS ? Apple Music has all these different playlists so sometimes I 'll just click the workout playlist and it will play songs like Panda and just like hyped songs where you have to just go hard . <p> DO YOU HAVE A TURN-UP SONG ? LIKE YOU HEAR THIS ONE SONG AND YOU 'RE READY TO GO.Recently it 's been One Dance by Drake . But the whole world is listening to it right now , so I kind of just stopped listening to it as much as I did . But when it first came out , that was my go-to song . <p> WHAT DO YOU NORMALLY WEAR WHEN YOU 'RE WORKING OUT ? I like wearing something breathable , not something too tight . I like wearing leggings and a good old running shoe " something supportive . And just like a sports bra and t-shirt on top , I do n't like wearing anything too tight just because I want to feel like I can run around and not have to worry about what I look or what 's going on . <p> ARE YOU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm against wearing makeup when I work out because I feel like your pores are open and you 're sweating and it 's going to come off anyways . And then all the makeup is creating dirt on your face and it 's going into your skin . I 'm very against that " unless you 're doing like a gym photo shoot , which a lot of people do , go to the gym just to take photos . But I 'm against wearing makeup for doing anything active , unless it 's being filmed . Everyone has their personal preference , but I like to take care of my skin . <p> DO YOU DO ANY SPECIAL TREATMENTS FOR YOUR SKIN ? I actually love skincare . Hopefully one day I will have my own skincare line . I just always try to make sure I take off all my makeup before I go to sleep , wash my face every morning and every night . I tend to have kind of dry skin , so I do n't use too many toners , but I love like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refreshing . <p> AND DO YOU HAVE A FAVOURITE NON-HEALTHY MEAL ? - LIKE FAST FOOD , ANYTHING LIKE THAT ?

If you stopped by any of their stores lately , you know what I mean . Since I already own millions of denims , I decided to pick out some pieces from the spring collection that might be overlooked . I fell in love with this cosy two toned sweater not only because of the colour , but the beading details on the shoulders . Unfortunately you cant see it online nor in my pictures . The sweater also comes in navy . I decided to pair it with this cropped faux leather jacket also available at Addition Elle . For a long time anything cropped was a no no in my books , but the trick with cropped jackets is to pair them with sweaters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept my top half in the same colour family , I chose to do a pop of colour with my little pink kitten heels .

With her passion for beauty and makeup , she is dedicated to providing- you with the latest trends and tips and tricks on all things pretty ! - - Visit her website at : - www.makeupbybrittany.com <p> With the summer months upon us it 's so nice to rock a beautiful healthy glow ! Weekends at the cottage , beach days and summer BBQ 's may have given you a little colour and vitamin D but adding a little self tan to boost your natural glow is a great and healthy way to step up your tan ! It 's also a great way to get some colour before you attend these events , exposing areas of your body that may not have seen the sun in months . <h> First off , pick up a self tanner . <p> There are so many on the market now and personally , I think it 's a bit of a trial and error game in order to find the one that works for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so well when using the mitt applicator and you are able to see where it 's going so you can avoid streaks and blotches . <p> I am a bit of a self tanning junkie , and I have tried and use many that I love for different reasons . Sprays , mousse , wipes , lotions so many different options . No matter what type of product you use you always want to protect your hands . Tanned palms is just not a good look and totally gives away your self tanning secrets . I suggest picking up a self tanning mitt that is usually sold with a mouse product . For lotions , sprays , or liquids I suggest picking up a box of latex gloves at your local drugstore for less than $3 for a pack of 50 . <p> If you are looking for a brand to try my go to favourite self tan is St Tropez tanning mousse . They also sell over textures like lotions and sprays . <h> Now let 's talk a bit about prep and preservation . <p> Before you apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaved and exfoliated . I also like to apply a water based moisturizer all over . Some brands say to only apply to knees and elbows but if you use a lightweight moisturizer all over I find it helps the self tan absorb into the skin better . If you apply self tanner on to dry , dehydrated skin it will just sit on top of the skin and not sink in . <p> Wherever you apply your self tan you want to exfoliate , I like to use a facial scrub and body scrub but you can also just use a luffa and scrub your skin well with it . <p> Use a body lotion as opposed to a body butter or body cream . Lotions tend to be more lightweight and water based . To check if your lotion is water based , read the ingredients and if water/aqua is the first ingredient on the list , that means it is water based . <h> Once you have applied your tan here are some tips to preserve it <p> I tend to suggest applying it at night before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lukewarm shower and do n't exfoliate or scrub , just rinse off and wash your body . Once out of the shower , instead of rubbing your body dry just pat gently leaving some moisture . Next up apply a body butter or cream , something super hydrating . This helps lock in the tan and keeps it absorbing into the skin . You can apply self tanner a few days in a row to achieve your desired results , then rock your tan for however long it lasts ! <p> Once you notice it fading or maybe becoming blotchy where you bra sits , repeat the first instructions again , hop in the shower and exfoliate from head to toe thoroughly , removing the old tan and provided a smooth surface for your next applications ! <h> Here is a summer makeup look a created just after applying my St Tropez tanning mousse for a couple days <p> Brittany Hall is a professional makeup artist and freelance blogger .

With her passion for beauty and makeup , she is dedicated to providing- you with the latest trends and tips and tricks on all things pretty ! - - Visit her website at : - www.makeupbybrittany.com <h> How To Create The Bronze Smokey Eye <h> Hello to all you fashion and beauty enthusiasts ! <p> The bronze smokey eye is a great look for all year round but I especially love it for spring/summer . A bronze/brown natural smokey eye is perfect for everyday or a night out . It looks natural and easy going but still has that glowing appeal we all love . With spring around the corner it 's nice to switch up your makeup routine try something new ! <p> To really enhance this look I suggest applying a self tanner the night before . Not only will a little extra colour really compliment this look but do n't we all feel a little better with a tan ? Even if it 's just a soft minimal glow from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's get started with a step by step guide to creating this Bronzing Natural Eye <p> 1 . Always start with a clean , primed eye lid . <p> 2 . Apply a gold shadow all over the lid . I used Amber Lights by MAC Cosmetics . Use a flat dense brush to apply and press the shadow onto the lid . This will help avoid fall-out ( when shadow dusts onto your under eye ) and will also help you get an awesome colour payoff ! <p> 3 . Apply a soft neutral beige into the crease with a blending brush . I used Soba by MAC . Please feel free to adjust these colours based on your skin complexion . If you are a bit darker , for this step , you may want to use something neutral to your skin tone ! <p> 4 . Apply a brow highlight and blend it down into the crease . I used Naked Lunch by MAC . Again with this step , you want to use a flat brush and press the product on then soften and blend out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wee bit by adding a touch of Handwritten by MAC into the outer corner . Hand Written is a dark/bricky brown any colour like that will work ! Use the same blending brush as used in step 3 . <p> 6 . Apply a soft brown pencil liner along the lash line winging up and out . Be sure to really rub the liner into the root of the lash , ensuring no skin can be seen . We want the lash line to be fully saturated enhancing the lashes ! <p> 7 . Take a smudge brush or a stiff brush that does n't bend much and soften this line up . <p> 8 . Next up , apply mascara and if you wish false lashes as well ! <p> 9 . To finish off the look , pick up a bit of Handwritten ( dark brown ) and apply it along the lower lash line sticking to the outer half of the lid . Then pick up a bit of Amber Lights ( gold ) and blend it out and soften it up ! <p> Here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer look at the products used . Feel free to use the same products or find similar ones in your makeup bag ! <p> I finished off the look using pink accents . I really like a nice bronzed look accented with pink hues very springy ! Apply a pink lipstick and blush and away you go ! <p> Brittany Hall is a professional makeup artist and freelance blogger .

It 's form fitting , but not so clingy that you see all the stuff you 'd rather hide ! The only reason I ca n't pull the trigger on this dress is that it does n't have more colours to choose from . I 'd have loved a dark forest green or something that was a bit less attention grabbing ( but not boring-black , either ) . 165341 @qwx365341 165325 @qwx365325 <p> Follow Us 165322 @qwx365322 165324 @qwx365324

And , you 'd think the pattern and lace matching would a bit ' much ' , but it 's just so delish.Use the size calculator to get the fit fit .

It looks a bit ridiculous - palm leaves with pink maple leaves ? Weird . I only tried it on out of desperation to find a dress for a wedding and I 'm glad I did . <p> The way it hangs and hugs the body makes everything make sense . The colours become very flattering and the peculiar pattern falls into the background , just leaving a nice design accent . If you 're like me and have a large bust that is n't very well accommodated by many dressed sold at AE , consider trying this dress . The stretchier fabric fits the bust , makes it look sexy with that little peephole neckline , and it still does up at the back ! ! <p> It 's as pretty as the picture . Fits well and it 's hangs just at the knees . Fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice summer dress to wear anywhere I would like to go and I can dress it up or down . 165341 @qwx365341 165325 @qwx365325 <p> Follow Us 165322 @qwx365322 165324 @qwx365324
