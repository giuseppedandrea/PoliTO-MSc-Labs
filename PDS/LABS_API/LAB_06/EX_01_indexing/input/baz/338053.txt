Currently , the standard yield cartridges are being sold for $14.90 ( black ) and $19.99 ( color ) when purchased separately . Again , the printer only cost $29.99 . Youd actually be saving money by buying a new printer rather than paying for replacement cartridges ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasteful as to purchase a new printer after their free cartridges expire just to save a few bucks . The glaring price discrepancy between device and consumable does , however , highlight what printer brands have been doing successfully for years : setting a high price on the consumables so they can make up for the money lost on the printer and then some . Actually , some is n't the right word . Its a lot . <p> So be wary of low-costing inkjet printers , typically ones below the $75 range . Even if the cost of replacement cartridges do n't  quite exceed the price of the device , you 'll still be paying more than you should for consumables . <p> What if a printer of $100 or more is n't within your budget ? Try ditching printer brand ink . Independent suppliers of print consumables , like 123inkjets , specialize in providing name brand results at affordable prices .

But if you make your own with the help of 123inkjets , not only will they have a more lasting impact for your own studying efforts , but they can also be made to be more sturdy and resistant . You will also want to consider a containing device for these cards . <p> In order to make your own set you will need cardstock , glue or two-sided tape , scissors , adhesive spray , laminating film ( available by the roll or in pre-cut 11+13 sheets , can buy it online , in stores or directly from most paper companies ) and plenty of printer ink . You may also want to locate some digital images , which will become the backs of the cards . These can be family photos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at sites like www.images.google.com . You will need to use a photo editing software to resize and crop these photos ( as well as photos that may be needed for the faces of the flash cards ) to fit your card backs ( 3 ? tall by 2 ? wide will be best ) . <p> The first step of this project is to open your word processing software ( these instructions pertain to the Microsoft Word 2007 format , but most softwares will have the same or very similar controls ) . To begin , then select " shapes . " Choose the rectangle with rounded corners tool and use it to draw . Do not worry about the circle being perfect , because once drawn you can go to the " format " tab and adjust the height and width ( these controls are found all the way to the right of the toolbar ) .

From the drop down box select " draw text box . " Draw the text box so that it is completely within the border of the rectangle , select a font type , color , and size , then type a word or short phrase that seems holiday appropriate .

Do not print on both sides of the paper . It is better to have the added stability of multiple pieces of card stock . Cut each card out , and cut an equal number of blank card pieces .

Spray between each layer lightly with the adhesive spray and attach one of your card backs to each .

Once we receive your check we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Questions &amp; Answers <p> close <h> I ca n't tell the difference between standard yield and high yield . <p> While at certain times , there will not be a physical difference in the size of your cartridge ; a high-yield cartridge is a better value as it always contains more ink or toner . The size and shape of a cartridge will vary at times , but for the most part , the dimensions are set because they must fit into the printer . <p> Having more ink in a cartridge translates to a lower cost per page because , as a customer , you receive much more ink and many more prints for a price that is only marginally higher . <h> I ca n't create a new password . <p> You can only have one active password at a time . This means that if you lose a password and request a new one , any old passwords will no longer work . Even if you find it or remember it , you must still use the new one ; multiple attempts to use it will lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place to protect our users . If you have further problems with creating a new password , please contact our customer service staff at 888-321-2552 . <h> I did not receive a confirmation number . <p> We have an automated system that sends out confirmation emails after a purchase is made on our website . It only takes a few minutes , so within a short period of time , you should know if there has been a problem . Generally , issues are caused by mistyped email addresses . The second most frequent issue that we encounter is messages being captured by an email client 's SPAM filter . <p> Phone orders are manually entered into the system and for that reason there is a more a delay before customers with phone orders receive their confirmation email . <h> Why ca n't I track my international package ? <p> International customers should expect a short delay due to Customs inspections at the border . However once a package goes beyond US borders , we do not have the ability to track it . <h> Why does the cartridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some minor differences in the appearance of our compatible cartridges compared to the OEM products that they replace . This is done mostly to ensure that there is no confusion between them . With remanufactured cartridges , there are often parts that need to be repaired or replaced and those repairs can affect the appearance of the product that you buy . These changes , however , do not have any effect on performance . <h> How do I get discounts ( coupons ) ? <p> We have a plenty of outlets for accessing discounts and special sales . The simplest way to go about it would be to join our mailing list . We also announce our sales and other promotions on our Social Media channels . Our Facebook page and Twitter feed will have coupon codes , contests , and other opportunities to cut your ink and toner spending even more than our regular low prices ! <h> Why is the ink level reading low or empty ? <p> Depending on the kind of printer than you have , your printer and cartridge are attempting to communicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run out without realizing it . Sometimes , this process does not work with older printers and cartridges , or with remanufactured products . If this happens , you still have ink and you can print , but you will have to monitor your own use . <h> Why are the remanufactured and compatible cartridges so much cheaper ? <p> Our costs for bringing you these products are lower and our prices are lower as a result . Because our compatible cartridges cost less to make and have much less overhead cost attached to them , our prices on these brand-new products is still very low .
