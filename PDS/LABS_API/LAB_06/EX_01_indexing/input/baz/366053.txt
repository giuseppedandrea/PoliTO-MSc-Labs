They are the youths who are not satisfied with a basic understanding but want to delve into why and how something works the way it does . <p> While the academy has various guest speakers from a few local sources , Carolynn says that Knight 's has been the biggest sponsor and affords the students an experience that they could never receive sitting in a classroom . Knight 's provides engineers , welders , machine operators , electricians , and even support from human resources who provide tips to students on job hunting and interviewing techniques .

He was inspired to enter the academy to follow in his father 's footsteps in the manufacturing sector ( his father happens to be our facility 's General Manager ) . This is his second year with the academy and he says it really gives him the opportunity to see what his chosen career path would entail . Justin says that the field trips and team projects are the most beneficial aspects of the program .

Current weather conditions including wind speed and direction can be input , as well as angles to the target as measured by the built-in accelerometer - provides highly detailed solutions out to 2000 meters . Your weapon profile includes your scope MOA per click , and hence when you provide a range to the target , the app will simply say how many clicks you need to change the scope by for that range and wind speed . <p> Environmental calculations are based on the Sierra Bullets(tm) model as detailed in their external ballistics literature . Up to five ballistic coefficients with corresponding velocity thresholds may be used for each profile . The built-in help page includes live links to online resources for BC values . <p> Several built-in profiles for the Army 's M110 semi-automatic precision rifle , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .308 M40A3 , .308 M24 , and the 6.5mm KAC PDW allow you to get started quickly .

If you enter a value that is too high or too low , the field may automatically change to a common value . Consider this a hint to change the field once more to a value that is reasonable . Most fields are self-explanatory but if you have questions please contact us before use . Here are some fields that need special attention : <p> For scope clicks , put in how many MOA ( minutes of angle ) the bullet impact will change for each scope click . Note that there are two fields - one for H ( horizontal ) and one for V ( vertical ) . Some scopes , but not many , have different settings for each turret . <p> For BC ( ballistic coefficient ) , note that Standard Metro G1 drag-function BC must be used ( not ICAO values nor any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BC values exclusively in Metro/G1 format . If you only have a singular value , place it in the first field , and make sure the other fields ( including the Fps fields to the right ) are set to 0 . If you have more values , start at the top and work down - and ensure that the additional fields are set to 0 . Note that the purpose of the Fps fields are to give the velocity threshold that will decide if the next-higher or next-lower BC is used . <p> When you are happy with your data , edit the profile name at the top and select Save . If the profile name is already in use , that profile will be updated . If it is not in use , a new profile will be created . <p> The Remove button will erase a profile , and the Cancel button will revert to the main screen and not save anything . <p> Now in more detail , from the main screen , you may select a stored profile and select Calculate Ballistics or Calculate Simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will appear , and as you change values , the results will update . Anything you place in these fields will be saved for the next time you return to this screen . They will also be saved and used in the Calculate Simple screen . <p> The Range-field is the distance to the target . The Temp is the current temperature . The correction factors based on the local environment were coded based on correction factors provided by Sierra 's ( the bullet manufacturer 's ) external ballistic research . Pressure needs the local atmospheric pressure as reported by a weather station ( which does not factor in altitude ) . If you are not sure what to enter for any value , picking something out of range will often automatically put in a reasonable value for your consideration , but please verify that this is what you would like to use .

Note that the automatic get will generally not return more or less than 45 degrees because it switches modes depending on the orientation . If you are not getting the angle you desire , please enter it manually . Wind Angle is 90 degrees for a cross wind , 0 degrees is toward the rifle , and 180 degrees is downrange . <p> The output will show the predicted bullet impact above or below the LOS ( line of sight ) in inches or cm ( change the units from the Options button on the main screen . The second output value is the height in MOA or mRad ( milliradians ) above or below the LOS ( also depending on the setting under Options ) . The third value is how many clicks to adjust your scope from zero ( this refers back to when you set up the amount that MOA changes per scope click ) . Below that is the windage output . This will update based on the wind-speed and direction you entered . Finally , the lowest display will estimate velocity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Options screen . Time is estimated flight time from the rifle to the target and may help you with predicting how much to lead the target based on its speed . <p> If instead you had pressed the Calculate Simple button , you will have less information to enter to allow for use under stress . This screen is best to use once you are in position , as environmental conditions typically do not change . Rather than a text-box to enter range , there is a large selection wheel . The wheel allows for entry using yards or meters , depending on what you have set on the Options page . Wind velocity is still settable with a text-box but wind direction is only settable from the full calculate page . It is important to note that the environmentals , including wind angle , and other settings ( including rifle angle ) you have set on the full calculate page are still being used so make sure that they match the current conditions .
