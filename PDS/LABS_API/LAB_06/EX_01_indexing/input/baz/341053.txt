@@58326264 @7326264/ <p> As part of its ongoing distribution network optimization efforts , Spartan Stores , Inc. , ( Nasdaq:SPTN ) today announced that it plans to operate all supply chain activities from its Grand Rapids , Michigan distribution center . <p> Part of the optimization strategy includes the potential closure of the Company 's 415,000 sq . ft . Plymouth , Michigan dry grocery warehouse by the end of its fiscal 2010 fourth quarter . The Plymouth warehouse operating lease is set to expire in October 2010 and the Company 's current collective bargaining agreement with employees at the facility will expire in April 2010 . The Company intends to promptly engage in negotiations with the Teamsters Local 337 , which represents the approximately 140 Plymouth , Michigan facility bargaining unit employees , prior to making a final decision on closing the Plymouth facility . As part of the negotiations , the Company expects to offer employment opportunities for Plymouth Teamster employees at its Grand Rapids , Michigan distribution center . In conjunction with the warehouse optimization , the Company will implement an administrative cost reduction initiative . <p> These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency by increasing inventory turns , warehouse thru-put and capacity utilization , while reducing administrative expenses and inventory investment requirements . If the closing and optimization of the warehouse facility are implemented , along with the administrative cost reduction initiative , the Company expects to incur a fiscal 2010 fourth-quarter net after tax charge of approximately $1.5 to $2.0 million for severance , warehouse and asset impairment costs . The Company also expects to incur a fiscal 2011 first-quarter net after tax benefit of approximately $0.2 to $0.6 million for a favorable LIFO benefit due to inventory reductions net of lease termination and additional distribution center closing costs that are anticipated to occur during the quarter . Excluding the previously mentioned charges , annualized after tax cost savings from these initiatives are expected to range from approximately $2.0 million to $3.0 million . <p> " The optimization of our distribution facilities and the current economic conditions provided us with an opportunity to restructure certain aspects of our organization , " said Mr. Eidson . " As such , we will be able to eliminate a number of administrative positions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help ensure that we continue to remain the low cost supplier in our markets for many years to come . " <p> Mr. Eidson continued , " As previously disclosed , we expected the near-term economic climate in Michigan to continue weakening and pressure our sales and earnings performance as the year progressed . Based on our current view of market trends and Michigan 's nation leading unemployment rate of nearly 15 percent , these expectations are materializing . The economic climate in Michigan remains challenging due to the persistent high unemployment rate and tightening consumer spending patterns . In addition , we continue to experience price deflation in some high volume product categories , pricing pressure in fuel and heightened competition in certain markets due to new store openings . Consequently , we now expect comparable store sales to be in the negative mid-single digit range for the third and fourth quarters compared with our previous expectation of a decline in the low-to-mid single digit range . We also now expect a commensurate sales decline in our distribution segment , excluding the elimination effect on distribution sales related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth quarters will be affected by these circumstances and we now expect fiscal 2010 's third quarter earnings per share to range between $0.21 and $0.25 .
