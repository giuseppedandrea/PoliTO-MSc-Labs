@@35402029 @4402029/ <h> Analog 5.2 : Inclusions and exclusions <p> After aliasing each item , analog decides whether that item is wanted or not . The whole line is only counted if all the items are wanted . Whether an item is wanted or not is determined by INCLUDE and EXCLUDE commands specified by the user . These commands can be used to exclude requests from your local users , for example , or to analyse only files in a subdirectory . For example <p> HOSTEXCLUDE mycomputer.myisp.com <p> would exclude all requests by that computer from the statistics . ( To exclude lines just from one specific report , see below . ) <p> The rule for determining whether an item is included or excluded is as follows . All the INCLUDE and EXCLUDE commands for that item are considered one by one in order , and the item is included or excluded according to the last command it matched . Items which do n't match any of the INCLUDE or EXCLUDE commands are included if the first command was an exclusion , and excluded if the first command was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program to examine only my files , excluding my backgammon and analog files , but including gifs in my backgammon directory . On the other hand , <p> FILEEXCLUDE /sret1/*/img/* <p> would analyse all files , except for images in my various directories . ( If you get confused with all the inclusions and exclusions , remember that you can always use SETTINGS ON to see what the options you have specified represent . ) Note that inclusions and exclusions can contain any number of wildcards , and can be lists separated by commas ( but no spaces ) . <p> The full list of these commands is HOSTINCLUDE and HOSTEXCLUDE ; FILEINCLUDE and FILEEXCLUDE ; BROWINCLUDE and BROWEXCLUDE ; REFINCLUDE and REFEXCLUDE ; USERINCLUDE and USEREXCLUDE ; VHOSTINCLUDE and VHOSTEXCLUDE ; and STATUSINCLUDE and STATUSEXCLUDE . <p> Some notes on these commands . <p> Because the inclusions and exclusions take place after the aliasing , the name you must use is the aliased name . ( In the absence of output alias commands , this is the name of the item in the output . ) <p> Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either because there is no field reserved for it on the line , or because the browser did n't send it for that request , or because it was present but corrupt . You can include or exclude these lines by making a special blank entry in the INCLUDE or EXCLUDE command . For example , <p> USERINCLUDE jim USERINCLUDE " " <p> would include lines from user jim and lines without any user specified . <p> The behaviour of REQINCLUDE and REFINCLUDE can be slightly unintuitive if the file has search arguments . <p> You can also use regular expressions for the inclusions and exclusions by prefixing the expression with " REGEXP : " or " REGEXPI : " . I 've already described this at length in the context of aliases , so you can look there for all the details . A regular expression must be on a line on its own , not within a comma-separated list . <p> The STATUSINCLUDE and STATUSEXCLUDE commands are slightly different from the rest . They work on HTTP status codes . ( These codes are defined in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if you do n't already know about them , you really do n't want to use these commands anyway ! ) The arguments to the commands are a comma-separated list of ranges . One end of the range can be blank , meaning from the first , or to the last , status code . For example <p> STATUSINCLUDE 200-206,304,500- <p> would mean only look at lines with status codes 200-206 , 304 or 500-599 . <p> Some people want to exclude status code 304 ( Not Modified ) to stop those requests appearing in the Request Report . But there is a better solution . By default , analog counts code 304 as a successful request , because it assumes that the cached version of the document is then presented to the user . But you can count it as a redirected request with the command <p> 304ISSUCCESS OFF <p> Again , if you do n't understand this , stick with the default . There is also one other pair of commands which belongs in this category , namely the FROM and TO commands . These specify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplest usage of these commands is FROM yyMMdd or FROM yyMMdd:hhmm , where yy represents the last two digits of the year ( analog assumes that the year is between 1970 and 2069 ) , MM represents the month , dd is the date , hh the hour , and mm the minute . So , for example , to analyse only requests from 1st July 1999 to 1pm on 15th June 2000 I would use the configuration <p> FROM 990701 TO 000615:1300 <p> Alternatively , each of the components can be preceded by + or - to represent time relative to the time at which the program was invoked . In this case , the date can have more than 2 digits . This allows constructions like <p> FROM -01-00+01 # from tomorrow last year TO -00-0131 # to the end of last month ( OK even if last month # did n't have 31 days ) FROM -00-00-112 TO -00-00-01 # statistics for the last 16 weeks FROM -00-00-00 : -06+01 # statistics for the last 6 hours <p> There are command line abbreviations +F and +T for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks at statistics until 6pm yesterday . -F and -T turn off the from and to , as do FROM OFF and TO OFF . There are alsoINCLUDE and EXCLUDE commands for most of the reports . Unlike the INCLUDE and EXCLUDE commands discussed above , these just exclude individual lines from particular reports . So , for example , the command <p> REFREPEXCLUDE http : //your.site.com/* <p> would exclude your internal referrers from the Referrer Report . However , it would not exclude them from the Failed Referrer Report , the Referring Site Report , etc. ( you need to use FAILREFEXCLUDE , REFSITEEXCLUDE etc. for that ) ; nor would it prevent other analysis of logfile lines with those referrers , as REFEXCLUDE would . <p> The full list of these commands is REQINCLUDE and REQEXCLUDE ; REDIRINCLUDE and REDIREXCLUDE ; FAILINCLUDE and FAILEXCLUDE ; TYPEINCLUDE and TYPEEXCLUDE ; DIRINCLUDE and DIREXCLUDE ; HOSTREPINCLUDE and HOSTREPEXCLUDE ; REDIRHOSTINCLUDE and REDIRHOSTEXCLUDE ; FAILHOSTINCLUDE and FAILHOSTEXCLUDE ; DOMINCLUDE and DOMEXCLUDE ; ORGINCLUDE and ORGEXCLUDE ; REFREPINCLUDE and REFREPEXCLUDE ; REFSITEINCLUDE and REFSITEEXCLUDE ; SEARCHQUERYINCLUDE and SEARCHQUERYEXCLUDE ; SEARCHWORDINCLUDE and SEARCHWORDEXCLUDE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and REDIRREFEXCLUDE ; FAILREFINCLUDE and FAILREFEXCLUDE ; BROWSUMINCLUDE and BROWSUMEXCLUDE ; BROWREPINCLUDE and BROWREPEXCLUDE ; OSINCLUDE and OSEXCLUDE ; VHOSTREPINCLUDE and VHOSTREPEXCLUDE ; REDIRVHOSTREPINCLUDE and REDIRVHOSTREPEXCLUDE ; FAILVHOSTREPINCLUDE and FAILVHOSTREPEXCLUDE ; USERREPINCLUDE and USERREPEXCLUDE ; REDIRUSERREPINCLUDE and REDIRUSERREPEXCLUDE ; and FAILUSERINCLUDE and FAILUSEREXCLUDE . <p> The inclusion or exclusion applies to the unaliased name , if you are doing any output aliases . ( This contrasts with the behaviour of normal INCLUDE and EXCLUDE commands , which apply to the aliased name . ) <p> All directory names end in slashes , so DIRINCLUDE and DIREXCLUDE , and REFSITEINCLUDE and REFSITEEXCLUDE , implicitly add a trailing slash even if you do n't give one . This sometimes catches people out in the following situation . <p> REFSITEEXCLUDE http : //my.host.com/* # probably not what you want <p> means not to list subdirectories of the referring site http : //my.host.com/ , but to keep the site itself in the list . To exclude the site completely , just use <p> REFSITEEXCLUDE http : //my.host.com/ <p> You can also use the symbolic word pages in suitable INCLUDE and EXCLUDE commands ; one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only pages in the Request Report . There are some miscellaneous INCLUDE and EXCLUDE commands which I 'll describe now . First , analog determines which files should count as pages ( and thus which requests count as page requests ) using an INCLUDE/EXCLUDE pair called PAGEINCLUDE and PAGEEXCLUDE . By default , ( case insensitive ) *. html and *. htm , and directories ( */ ) count as pages . But you change the list by commands like <p> PAGEINCLUDE *. asp PAGEEXCLUDE /sret1.html <p> I.e. , *. asp are pages , but /sret1.html is n't . ( If the file has search arguments , the PAGEINCLUDE and PAGEEXCLUDE are reckoned just on the part of the filename before the question mark . ) In some of the reports , analog can link to the files which it 's listing . You can specify exactly which files are linked to with the LINKINCLUDE family of commands . For example , <p> REQLINKINCLUDE pages , *. pdf <p> would link to pages and PDF files in the Request Report . The full set of these commands is REQLINKINCLUDE and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Redirection Report ) , FAILLINKINCLUDE and FAILLINKEXCLUDE ( Failure Report ) , REFLINKINCLUDE and REFLINKEXCLUDE ( Referrer Report ) , REDIRREFLINKINCLUDE and REDIRREFLINKEXCLUDE ( Redirected Referrer Report ) , and FAILREFLINKINCLUDE and FAILREFLINKEXCLUDE ( Failed Referrer Report ) . Note that the target of the links is also affected by the BASEURL command . Finally , there is a pair of commands called ROBOTINCLUDE and ROBOTEXCLUDE , which determine which browsers count as " robots " in the Operating System Report . For example , <p> ROBOTINCLUDE Googlebot/* <p> There is one final set of INCLUDE and EXCLUDE commands to include or exclude the search arguments at the end of URLs . But there are some slightly complicated issues surrounding those , so they deserve a new section . Go to the analog home page .

@@35402048 @4402048/ <p> Sites are the physical topology of a network . Active Directory is the logical structure of the network . <p> You have designed an appropriate site topology to help optimize the exchange of data and directory information for NWtraders in Ireland . Each site is connected to other sites using a WAN link . <p> FAC1 , FAC2 , FAC3 , FAC4 , and EMEA1 are each in their own subnet but are connected via high-speed fiber links . Therefore , they meet the requirements for a single site . The connection between EMEA1 and HQ is a slower 256 K frame relay link and would suit a separate site to control replication traffic . There are no site aware applications installed to affect this design . <p> You have decided to use defaultipsitelink between the factory units because there are only two sites that require a single site link between them .

Although the HR application is site aware and will require changes to the IP subnets used in the factories , it will not affect the number of sites because the optimum site design already includes all of the factories within the same site .

@@35402062 @4402062/ <p> You convene a meeting with the management of NWtraders to discuss network security . First , you point out that non-installation of service packs can leave the network exposed to an elevation of privilege attack . You explain that Microsoft issues new service packs and hot fixes that are often designed to secure known security holes in existing systems that permit a previously unknown threat to degrade the viability of the system . Ensuring that the most up-to-date security patches and hot fixes are installed will greatly strengthen the integrity of NWtraders ' systems . <p> You also point out that unused system services not required by the servers to carry out their functions should be removed or disabled , thus avoiding the potential for those services to be used by would-be attackers . <p> You show how a denial of service attack could cripple the proposed new Trade web site by not including sufficient redundancy levels . You explain how multiple T2 connections require multiple IP addresses , so in the event of an attacker targeting one connection , the redundant connection will still be serviceable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Trade Web server is just as prone to a denial of service attack and should also be duplicated to facilitate redundancy to avert such an attack . <p> You point out that if you secure network connectivity through secure encryption and authentication processes , your focus should then turn to the physical placement of the servers . At this point , you illustrate the physical failings of the building layout that expose the network to tampering attacks . You show that both the SQL server and the Web server are the most vulnerable to a tampering attack due mostly to their exposed physical location . Because they are both located in server room 1 , which is easily accessible from the public reception area , an attacker could gain access to either or both of them and use a number of means to corrupt or destroy their data . <p> You note that proper accountability procedures are not in place on the existing network and so it is vulnerable to repudiation attacks . You explain to management that repudiation is the ability to deny the occurrence of an event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of the event is not available . Highlighting that 60 percent of internal attacks originate from internal sources , you emphasize that storing information about user activities and important events for later analysis is vital in avoiding repudiation attacks . You explain that digital certificates can be used to identify users who log onto the trade.nwtraders.com domain . The digital certificate can also be used to determine the allowed permissions and access rights assigned to network clients . A record of all subsequent transactions can then be kept and used to either catch or deter attackers or would-be attackers . <p> You acknowledge the sensitive nature of the data to be stored within the Trade domain and point out the existing dangers of a potential attack in the form of information disclosure . To highlight this , you remind management that the SQL server holds mission-critical data that requires the most secure protection and that there is no need for this data to be located within the screened subnet . You explain that using the screened subnet with its two firewalls as a buffer between the SQL server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SQL server and its data . <p> Finally , you illustrate to management that all of the servers within the screened subnet are susceptible to a spoofing attack . In this type of attack , an attacker could simply run a network sniffer on the wire and use the captured data to replay network IDs , spoofed MAC addresses , and so on . You indicate that communication between the Web server and the Order Pro server should be made secure using an encryption protocol , and the Web server should use SSL or some other equally secure encrypted protocol for all communication from and to the Internet.

This granular method of training is the key to your learning success at Logilent . <p> Logilent organizes its instruction into five granular categories . A program is a set of courses recognized by an industry vendor or association typically accompanied by a certification ( i.e. , MCSE , A+ ) . A course is one subject within a program with multiple lessons ( i.e. , Upgrading Microsoft Windows NT 4. to Windows 2000 , Course #1560 ) . A lesson identifies several key learning objectives , similar to a class syllabus . Each learning objective uses a variety of multi-sensory learning tools , including live product labs , 24/7 mentoring , videos , books , courseware , lecture notes , case study exercises , exam prep , and community . <p> The Training EnvironmentThere are five main areas of the Logilent Training Environment : <p> The Classroom is the first area you enter to review the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lesson Plan is the main training area to initiate assessment , study objectives , and access the learning tools . <p> The Community area links you to other students for live and scheduled chat sessions . <p> In Administration you can check your progress , view notices , access orientation , or complete a course evaluation . <p> In My Campus you can review posted news , events , bulletin boards and tips . <p> Your Personal Lesson PlanTo begin your training session , select the " Start Here " link in the Classroom .

@@35402079 @4402079/ <h> Analog 5.2 : How the web works <p> This section is about what happens when somebody connects to your web site , and what statistics you can and ca n't calculate . There is a lot of confusion about this . It 's not helped by statistics programs which claim to calculate things which can not really be calculated , only estimated . The simple fact is that certain data which we would like to know and which we expect to know are simply not available . And the estimates used by other programs are not just a bit off , but can be very , very wrong . For example ( you 'll see why below ) , if your home page has 10 graphics on , and an AOL user visits it , most programs will count that as 11 different visitors ! <p> This section is fairly long , but it 's worth reading carefully . If you understand the basics of how the web works , you will understand what your web statistics are really telling you . <p> 1 . The basic model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I follow a link from somewhere else to your front page , read some pages , and then follow one of your links out of your site . <p> So , what do you know about it ? First , I make one request for your front page . You know the date and time of the request and which page I asked for ( of course ) , and the internet address of my computer ( my host ) . I also usually tell you which page referred me to your site , and the make and model of my browser . I do not tell you my username or my email address . <p> Next , I look at the page ( or rather my browser does ) to see if it 's got any graphics on it . If so , and if I 've got image loading turned on in my browser , I make a separate connection to retrieve each of these graphics . I never log into your site : I just make a sequence of requests , one for each new file I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these graphics is your front page . Maybe there are 10 graphics on your front page . Then so far I 've made 11 requests to your server . <p> After that , I go and visit some of your other pages , making a new request for each page and graphic that I want . Finally , I follow a link out of your site . You never know about that at all . I just connect to the next site without telling you . <p> 2 . Caches . It 's not always quite as simple as that . One major problem is caching . There are two major types of caching . First , my browser automatically caches files when I download them . This means that if I visit them again , the next day say , I do n't need to download the whole page again . Depending on the settings on my browser , I might check with you that the page has n't changed : in that case , you do know about it , and analog will count it as a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browser not to check with you : then I will read the page again without you ever knowing about it . <p> The other sort of cache is on a larger scale . Almost all ISP 's now have their own cache . This means that if I try to look at one of your pages and anyone else from the same ISP has looked at that page recently , the cache will have saved it , and will give it out to me without ever telling you about it . ( This applies whatever my browser settings . ) So hundreds of people could read your pages , even though you 'd only sent it out once . <p> 3 . What you can know . The only things you can know for certain are the number of requests made to your server , when they were made , which files were asked for , and which host asked you for them . <p> You can also know what people told you their browsers were , and what the referring pages were . You should be aware , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browser they are , or even let users configure the browser name . Also , a few browsers send incorrect referrers , telling you the last page that the user was on even if they were n't referred by that page . And some people use " anonymizers " which deliberately send false browsers and referrers . <p> 4 . What you ca n't know . <p> You ca n't tell the identity of your readers . Unless you explicitly require users to provide a password , you do n't know who connected or what their email addresses are . <p> You ca n't tell how many visitors you 've had . You can guess by looking at the number of distinct hosts that have requested things from you . Indeed this is what many programs mean when they report " visitors " . But this is not always a good estimate for three reasons . First , if users get your pages from a local cache server , you will never know about it . Secondly , sometimes many users appear to connect from the same host : either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the same cache server . Finally , sometimes one user appears to connect from many different hosts . AOL now allocates users a different hostname for every request . So if your home page has 10 graphics on , and an AOL user visits it , most programs will count that as 11 different visitors ! <p> You ca n't tell how many visits you 've had . Many programs , under pressure from advertisers ' organisations , define a " visit " ( or " session " ) as a sequence of requests from the same host until there is a half-hour gap . This is an unsound method for several reasons . First , it assumes that each host corresponds to a separate person and vice versa . This is simply not true in the real world , as discussed in the last paragraph . Secondly , it assumes that there is never a half-hour gap in a genuine visit . This is also untrue . I quite often follow a link out of a site , then step back in my browser and continue with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really matter whether I do this 29 or 31 minutes later ? Finally , to make the computation tractable , such programs also need to assume that your logfile is in chronological order : it is n't always , and analog will produce the same results however you jumble the lines up . <p> Cookies do n't solve these problems . Some sites try to count their visitors by using cookies . This reduces the errors . But it ca n't solve the problem unless you refuse to let people read your pages who ca n't or wo n't take a cookie . And you still have to assume that your visitors will use the same cookie for their next request . <p> You ca n't follow a person 's path through your site . Even if you assume that each person corresponds one-to-one to a host , you do n't know their path through your site . It 's very common for people to go back to pages they 've downloaded before . You never know about these subsequent visits to that page , because their browser has cached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your site accurately . <p> You often ca n't tell where they entered your site , or where they found out about you from . If they are using a cache server , they will often be able to retrieve your home page from their cache , but not all of the subsequent pages they want to read . Then the first page you know about them requesting will be one in the middle of their true visit . <p> You ca n't tell how they left your site , or where they went next . They never tell you about their connection to another site , so there 's no way for you to know about it . <p> You ca n't tell how long people spent reading each page . Once again , you ca n't tell which pages they are reading between successive requests for pages . They might be reading some pages they downloaded earlier . They might have followed a link out of your site , and then come back later . They might have interrupted their reading for a quick game of Minesweeper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell how long people spent on your site . Apart from the problems in the previous point , there is one other complete show-stopper . Programs which report the time on the site count the time between the first and the last request . But they do n't count the time spent on the final page , and this is often the majority of the whole visit . <p> 5 . Real data . Of course , the important question is how much difference these theoretical difficulties make . In a recent paper ( World Wide Web , 2 , 29-45 ( 1999 ) : PDF 228kb ) , Peter Pirolli and James Pitkow of Xerox Palo Alto Research Center examined this question using a ten day long logfile from the xerox.com web site . One of their most striking conclusions is that different commonly-used methods can give very different results . For example , when trying to measure the median length of a visit , they got results from 137 seconds to 629 seconds , depending exactly what you count as a new visitor or a new visit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't consider the effect of server configuration changes such as refusing caching , which would change the results still more . 6 . Conclusion . The bottom line is that HTTP is a stateless protocol . That means that people do n't log in and retrieve several documents : they make a separate connection for each file they want . And a lot of the time they do n't even behave as if they were logged into one site . The world is a lot messier than this nanve view implies . That 's why analog reports requests , i.e. what is going on at your server , which you know , rather than guessing what the users are doing . <p> Defenders of counting visits etc. claim that these are just small approximations . I disagree . For example , almost everyone is now accessing the web through a cache . If the proportion of requests retrieved from the cache is 50% ( a not unrealistic figure ) then half of the users ' requests are n't being seen by the servers . <p> Other defenders of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something which you can use to compare sites . But this assumes that the approximations involved are comparable for different sites , and there 's no reason to suppose that this is true . Pirolli &amp; Pitkow 's results show that the figures you get depend very much on how you count them , as well as on your server configuration . And even once you 've agreed on methodology , different users on different sites have different patterns of behaviour , which affect the approximations in different ways : for example , Pirolli &amp; Pitkow found different characteristics of weekday and weekend users at their site . <p> I 've presented a somewhat negative view here , emphasising what you ca n't find out . Web statistics are still informative : it 's just important not to slip from " this page has received 30,000 requests " to " 30,000 people have read this page . " In some sense these problems are not really new to the web -- they are present just as much in print media too . For example , you only know how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read them . In print media we have learnt to live with these issues , using the data which are available , and it would be better if we did on the web too , rather than making up spurious numbers . <p> 7 . Acknowledgements and further reading . Many other people have made these points too . While originally writing this section , I benefited from three earlier expositions : Interpreting WWW Statistics by Doug Linder ; Getting Real about Usage Statistics by Tim Stehle ; and Making Sense of Web Usage Statistics by Dana Noonan . ( The last two do n't seem to be available on the web any more . ) <p> Another , extremely well-written document on these ideas is Measuring Web Site Usage : Log File Analysis by Susan Haigh and Janette Megarity . Being on a Canadian government site , it 's available in both English and French . Or for an even more negative point of view , you could read Why Web Usage Statistics are ( Worse Than ) Meaningless by Jeff Goldberg .

@@35402091 @4402091/ <p> One of the great things about Analog is that it can easily be used to offer different customised output to multiple virtual hosts on the same server . <p> This is an obvious asset if you host several domains on your server and want to offer all your customers the benefit of daily/weekly/monthly Analog stats , but not all of them require the same level of reporting or the same ' look ' . <p> This real-world example is based on Apache 1.3.12 running on RedHat Linux 6.1 , but should be applicable to any Unix-like platform . Steps Two and Three , and the general ideas , should be helpful on Windows NT and other operating systems , but for the details you 'll have to ask someone else : - ) <p> Note the order in which the LOGFILE and LOGFORMAT commands appear - if the LOGFORMAT REFERRER is not before the LOGFILE **34;72;TOOLONG , it wo n't work ! You can see also that we 're giving the reports for this domain their own logo at the top of the page and are using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential , but you ca n't beat the finishing touches : - ) <p> Now here 's the same section for the analog.cfg file for the other virtual host - which , yes , you 've guessed it , is called nuw-maasanalog.cfg . <p> So by this time , you get the idea . This domain do n't need the referrer report , but they would like their own groovy logo and stylesheet applied to the output . You can , of course , take the opportunity within each domain 's analog.cfg file to tweak the output appearance , request floors and so on according to each host 's requirements . <h> Step Three <p> We also want a report for our own use with a summary of the usage for all the virtual hosts . So we need to analyse all the logfiles together . The problem is that the filenames appear in the logfiles as just /index.html for example , but we want to see http : **28;108;TOOLONG , so that we know which files belong to which virtual hosts . This is where the second argument to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefix to add to the filenames in that logfile . You can see this in this configuration file , which we 'll call all.cfg : <p> Notice the SUBDIR command at the end . This enables us to see the amount of traffic for each virtual host in the Directory Report . This information is not in the Virtual Host Report , because the virtual host name is just part of the filename , not an item on its own . <p> When we run this report , analog will give us a " possible double counting " warning . This just means that the dates for the logfiles overlap , and it 's nothing to worry about because all the logfiles are from separate virtual hosts . <h> Step Four <p> Now we have to knock up a little shell script to tell Analog to make a report on the stats for our different hosts at runtime . This works for me : <p> Obviously , the first line reflects the location of my analog - yours may well be somewhere else . And of course , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need the . / at the beginning of each line . What we 're doing here is simply running Analog twice using a different config file each time . I wo n't say you can do this ad infinitum , but I 'm up to 20 virtual hosts and Analog processes the whole lot in seconds . The important switches are the -G , which tells Analog not to use the default config file , and the +g in front of each cfg filename , which tells Analog to use that particular config file . No , you do n't leave a space before the filename . <h> Step Five <p> Save the above script as ' runanalog ' ( or whatever ) and chmod it 755 . Now you can use the cron daemon to execute analog on all your virtual hosts automatically at whatever frequency you desire . In the case of Linux , this is a definite no-brainer as under /etc you will find the directories cron.daily , cron.weekly or cron.monthly . My users like to have their stats pages updated on a daily basis , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could equally run weekly or monthly . If you offer a different service to different hosts , you could have one ' runanalog ' or the daily stats junkies and another version in cron.monthly with the hosts that ca n't handle too much information . 
@@35402094 @4402094/ <h> Lesson 2.04 : What makes a good web site ? <p> All new web designers can learn a great deal about what looks good and what looks not so good by studying the design of pages they see on the Web . A new web designer has many factors to think about while producing their pages including the content , the overall look of the pages , the color scheme , the aesthetics , and the ease of navigation . Please keep the following elements in mind when designing your own web pages later in this module . <h> Design Tips <p> Here are a few tips that will help any web designer create great web pages and ultimately great web sites ! <p> Keep your content concise and free of grammatical , spelling , and typographical errors . Your content should be short and to the point . It should also be looked upon as a credible source of information . <p> Keep your web pages consistent . By using the same color scheme , heading format , text , buttons , and style , you make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your web site and have not been taken to another location on the Web by clicking on a link . <p> Always use contrasting colors for your background and text . This makes it easy for the viewer to read . Steer clear of using busy backgrounds that are hard to read . Please remember it is very difficult to read text that is put on a textured or patterned background . <p> It is considered " good design " to maintain pages that are simple and do not use all the bells and whistles that are available . Using animations , gimmicks , flashy backgrounds , etc. should all be done in moderation . <p> Do not use large images . Large images take a long time to download . Please keep this in mind and use small images that add meaning to the content of your page . Do not use images simply for decoration . <p> The rule of thumb is that the image should be no larger than 300 pixels on either side or 25k in size . If the image is larger and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should use a thumbnail image on your web page and link the thumbnail image to the larger image . <p> Preview your pages in multiple browsers to make sure you are happy with the way they look . Often pages will look different in Firefox , Internet Explorer , Safari , and others . <p> Always check to make sure your links are properly working and to check your links to the outside frequently . A good web designer knows that revisions and updates are mandatory to maintain a good web site . <h> Web Design Resources <p> Please visit the following links to learn more about web design . <p> https : **29;138;TOOLONG <p> LONG ... <p> LONG ... <p> http : //problemwebsites.com/ <h> Thank you for visitng WWVS !

You should be aware that browsers can lie about what sort of browser they are . <p> The Operating System Report lists the operating systems of the visitors whose browser types you know ( as far as possible : it 's not always possible to distinguish accurately between different Windows versions , for example , because the same browser can run on more than one Windows version ) .

Also , they do n't count towards the total number of items listed , so there are only 5 domains listed in the example above , as you can see in the first column . ( The N column is particularly useful in hierarchical reports for this reason . ) <p> You can control which items are listed on the lower levels by the SUB family of commands . There are also separate sub-SORTBY and sub-FLOOR commands for the lower levels .
