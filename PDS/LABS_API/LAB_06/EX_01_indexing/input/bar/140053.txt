@@35433935 @4433935/ <h> Rotational Spectroscopy <p> Molecular rotations require little energy to excite them . Pure rotation spectra occur in the microwave region of the spectrum ( 1 - 200 cm-1 ) . It is important to note that a molecule can not rotate about some arbitrary axis - the principle of conservation of angular momentum dictates that only a few rotations are possible . In general , rotation must be about the centre of mass of a molecule , and the axis must allow for conservation of angular momentum . In simple cases , this can often be recognised intuitively through symmetry - such as with the water molecule . <p> A pure rotation spectrum can only arise when the molecule possesses a permanent electric dipole moment . Like with vibrational spectroscopy , the physical effect that couples to photons is a changing dipole moment . Since molecular bond lengths remain constant in pure rotation , the magnitude of a molecule 's dipole can not change . However , since electric dipole is a vector quantity ( it has both size and direction ) rotation can cause a permanent dipole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since homonuclear molecules such as dinitrogen ( N2 ) have no dipole moment they have no rotation spectrum . Highly symmetric polyatomic molecules , such as carbon dioxide , also have no net dipole moment - the dipoles along the C-O bonds are always equal and opposite and cancel each other out . It is important to recognise also that if a molecule has a permanent dipole , but this dipole lies along the main rotation axis , then the molecule will not have a rotational spectrum - such as for a water molecule . <p> In pure rotational spectroscopy for a simple diatomic molecule , the energy levels - as displayed below - are given by EJ = BJ(J+1) , where J is the rotational quantum number , B is the rotational constant for the particular molecule given by B = h2 / 8p2I with the unit of Joules , where I is the moment of inertia , given by I = r2 - where r is the bond length of this particular diatomic molecule and is the reduced mass , given by = m1m2 / m1 + @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with selection rules . These rules restrict certain transitions from occuring - though often they can be broken . In pure rotational spectroscopy , the selection rule is ? J = 1 . <p> Note : After selecting a molecule , select the energy level again to observe its rotation . Changing the molecule 's orientation will cause it to display an incorrect rotation . <p> A rotational spectrum would have the following appearence . Each line corresponds to a transition between energy levels , as shown . Notice that there are no lines for , for example , J = 0 to J = 2 etc . This is because the pure rotation spectrum obeys the selection rule ? J = 1 . The energy gap between each level increases by 2B as the energy levels we consider increase by J = 1 . This leads to the line spacing of 2B in the spectrum . Each transition has an energy value of 2B more than the previous transition . <p> The Molecular Dipole <p> The presence of a permanent molecular dipole is a requirement for a molecule being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be immediately obvious where the dipole comes from , and what it is . <p> Essentially , the molecular dipole is the presence of the imbalance of charge in a molecule . The lack of an even distribution of charge leads to a potential difference between regions of the molecule . This leads to an effective , static , electric field on the molecule . It is this electric field that may couple to photons . The imbalance of charge in the molecule arises from a combination of Pauling electronegativity and molecular symmetry . For example , in BF3 ( shown below ) , each Fluorine atom is more electronegative than the central Boron atom ( 3.98 and 2.04 respectively ) .

They are not intended to be a comprehensive guide to spectroscopy , but rather a useful tool to help with the understanding of the basics of spectroscopy .

This is the key to calculating a wide variety of properties of the molecule . <p> In general , we can often look at two types of spectrum - absorption or emission . In an absorption spectrum , a molecule is bombarded with photons from a controlled source . Electrons within the molecule may be able to absorb discrete amounts of energy and make the transition from one energy level to another . If the molecule has been bombarded with photons whose range of energies is continuous , then photons , arriving at a detector , which have passed through the molecule would have all their original energies except those which had been absorbed by electrons in the molecule .

Following the excitation , the electrons in the excited states return to their original , most stable states - the " ground state " . This loss of energy can occur in a number of ways , but a very common way is by radiative emission of a photon .

The spring can be compressed , forcing the spheres close to each other - stretched , moving them apart - or allowed to freely come to rest in the spheres ' equilibrium positions . This can be shown in a potential energy curve : <p> However , not all energies are possible . The possible vibrational states are given by the vibration quantum number , v , and vibrational selection rule ? v = 1 . The energy of each level , Ev , is given by Ev = ( v+-+ ) h ?

However , this model is imperfect - it does not account for the posibility of bond dissociation ( under this model , the bond would never break , no matter the magnitude of the vibrational energy ) . It also does not account for extra repulsive effects at very small bond lengths caused by the electroweak force . This is the force which prevents atoms for being forced together as the distance between them gets very small ( the reason nuclear fusion only occurs at very high temperatures , for example ) .

The potential energy curve now looks like this : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rexp is no longer the same for all energy levels . One effect of the anharmonicity is this deformation as the energy of the vibrations increases . Another is that now , the vibrational energy levels are no longer equally spaced , but instead get closer together as the vibrational quantum number increases . This model also illustrates that there are n't an infinite number of vibrational energy levels - above some energy , the bond breaks and the molecule dissociates . <p> Vibrational energies occur roughly in the 100 - 4000 cm-1 ( about 1 - 50 kJ mol-1 ) , or infra-red ( IR ) region of the electromagnetic spectrum .

@@35434217 @4434217/ <h> Organo-main-group chemistry ( Boron ) <p> A controlled oxidation is required to remove the boron atom and reveal the useful organic fragment . The simplest is alkaline hydrogen peroxide , which replaces the carbon-carbon bond with a carbon-oxygen bond to give an alcohol . The oxidation occurs by nucleophilic attack of the hydroperoxide ion on the empty orbital of the boron atom , followed by a migration of the alkyl chain from boron to oxygen .

@@35434255 @4434255/ <p> About ----- Flot is a Javascript plotting library for jQuery . Read more at the website : http : **25;155;TOOLONG Take a look at the examples linked from above , they should give a good impression of what Flot can do and the source code of the examples is probably the fastest way to learn how to use Flot . Installation ------------ Just include the Javascript file after you 've included jQuery . Note that you need to get a version of Excanvas ( I currently suggest you take the one bundled with Flot as it contains a bugfix for drawing filled shapes ) which is canvas emulation on Internet Explorer . You can include the excanvas script like this : If it 's not working on your development IE 6.0 , check that it has support for VML which excanvas is relying on . It appears that some stripped down versions used for test environments on virtual machines lack the VML support . Also note that you need at least jQuery 1.2.1 . Basic usage ----------- Create a placeholder div to put the graph in : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ div , otherwise the plot library does n't know how to scale the graph . You can do it inline like this : <p> You can also do it with an external stylesheet . Make sure that the placeholder is n't within something with a display:none CSS property - in that case , Flot has trouble measuring label dimensions which results in garbled looks and might have trouble measuring the placeholder dimensions which is fatal ( it 'll throw an exception ) . Then when the div is ready in the DOM , which is usually on document ready , run the plot function : $. plot ( $ ( " #placeholder " ) , data , options ) ; Here , data is an array of data series and options is an object with settings if you want to customize the plot . Take a look at the examples for some ideas of what to put in or look at the reference in the file " API.txt " . Here 's a quick example that 'll draw a line from ( 0 , 0 ) to ( 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , yaxis : max : 1 ) ; The plot function immediately draws the chart and then returns a Plot object with a couple of methods . What 's with the name ? --------------------- First : it 's pronounced with a short o , like " plot " . Not like " flawed " . So " Flot " is like " Plot " . And if you look up " flot " in a Danish-to-English dictionary , some up the words that come up are " good-looking " , " attractive " , " stylish " , " smart " , " impressive " , " extravagant " . One of the main goals with Flot is pretty looks . Flot is supposed to be " flot " .
